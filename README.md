## About

Keeping phone too close to the face is not good for eyes.
So, I designed an android app which alerts the user when phone screen comes closer more then 18cm.

## Features
- Mesuares the distance between face and screen using OpenCV.
- The alert rings for 5s and then stops if the distance is correct otherwise continues to alert.


## Tech Stack

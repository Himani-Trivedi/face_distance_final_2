## About

Keeping phone too close to the face is not good.

So, I designed an android app which alerts the user when phone comes closer more then 18cm.

## Features
- Mesuares the distance between face and screen using OpenCV.
- When face is too close then OpenCV cann't detect the face, so then we measure the distance between eye and screen.
- The alert rings for 5s and then stops if the distance is correct otherwise continues to alert.

- Android 
- OpenCV
